This program is an effort to act as a usable interface with Trango Broadband Radio.  

In an normal inviroment you will have to telnet into these radios to get infomation on how well it connects to the AP.  

Where I work usully I run seveal commands while telneted into the radio.  Namely I use two commands "rssi r" and "su testrflink SU-NUMBER r".  The "rssi r" is a command that streams a constant info of the signal to the Access Point it is pointing at.  Then "su testrflink SU-NUMBER r" is a command that is issued in the access point that gives out a stream of it's test link of the radio wich is known by its SU-NUMBER.
